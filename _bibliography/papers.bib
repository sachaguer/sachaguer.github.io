 abstract = {{Cosmological information is encoded in the structure of galaxy clusters.
In Universes with less matter and larger initial density
perturbations, clusters form earlier and have more time to
accrete material, leading to a more extended infall region.
Thus, measuring the mean mass distribution in the infall region
provides a novel cosmological test. The infall region is largely
insensitive to baryonic physics, and provides a cleaner
structural test than other measures of cluster assembly time
such as concentration. We consider cluster samples from three
publicly available galaxy cluster catalogues: the Spectroscopic
Identification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS) catalogue, the X-ray
and Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect selected clusters in the meta-
catalogue M2C, and clusters identified in the Dark Energy
Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Legacy Imaging Survey. Using a
preliminary shape catalogue from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared
Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we derive excess surface mass
density profiles for each sample. We then compare the mean
profile for the DESI Legacy sample, which is the most complete,
to predictions from a suite of simulations covering a range of
{\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ and {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$,
obtaining constraints of {\ensuremath{\Omega}}$_{m}$ = 0.34
{\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.06 and {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{8}$ = 0.77
{\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.04. We also measure mean (comoving)
splashback radii for SPIDERS, M2C and DESI Legacy Imaging Survey
clusters of cMpc/h, cMpc/h and cMpc/h respectively. Performing
this analysis with the final UNIONS shape catalogue and the full
sample of spectroscopically observed clusters in DESI, we can
expect to improve on the best current constraints from cluster
abundance studies by a factor of 2 or more.}},

 abstract = {{Context. Weak gravitational lensing requires precise measurements of
galaxy shapes and therefore accurate knowledge of the point
spread function (PSF) model. The latter can be a source of
systematics that affect the shear two-point correlation
function. A key aspect of weak-lensing analysis is the
forecasting of the systematics due to the PSF. Aims. Correlation
functions of galaxies and the PSF, the so-called
{\ensuremath{\rho}} and {\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics, are used
to evaluate the level of systematics coming from the PSF model
and PSF corrections and contributing to the two-point
correlation function used to perform cosmological inference. Our
goal is to introduce a fast and simple method to estimate this
level of systematics and to assess its agreement with state-of-
the-art approaches. Methods. We introduce a new way to estimate
the covariance matrix of {\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics using
analytical expressions. The covariance allows us to estimate
parameters directly related to the level of systematics
associated with the PSF and provides us with a tool to validate
the PSF model used in a weak-lensing analysis. We applied these
methods to data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical
Northern Survey (UNIONS). Results. We show that semi-analytical
covariance yields results comparable to those obtained by using
covariances obtained from simulations or jackknife resampling.
The approach requires less computation time and is therefore
well suited to rapid comparison of the systematic level obtained
from different catalogues. We also show how one can break
degeneracies between parameters with a redefinition of the
{\ensuremath{\tau}} statistics. Conclusions. The methods
developed in this work will be useful tools in the analysis of
current weak-lensing data but also of Stage IV surveys such as
Euclid, LSST, and Roman. They provide fast and accurate
diagnostics on PSF systematics that are crucial in the context
of cosmic shear studies.}},

constrain the excess surface mass density of voids using weak
lensing. We present and validate a novel method for computing
the Gaussian component of the conventional weak lensing
covariance, adapted for use with void studies. We detect the
stacked weak lensing void density profile at the $6.2σ$ level,
the most significant detection of void lensing from
spectroscopically-identified voids to date. We find that large
and small voids have different matter density profiles, as
expected from numerical studies of void profiles. This
difference is significant at the $2.3σ$ level. Comparing the
void profile to a measurement of the void-galaxy cross-
correlation to test the linearity of the relationship between
mass and light, we find good visual agreement between the two,
and a galaxy bias factor of $2.45\pm0.36$, consistent with other
works. This work represents a promising detection of the lensing

 abstract = {{Context. During their formation, galaxies are subject to tidal forces,
which create correlations between their shapes and the large-
scale structure of the Universe, known as intrinsic alignment.
This alignment is a source of contamination for cosmic-shear
measurements as we need to disentangle correlations induced by
external lensing effects from those intrinsically present in
galaxies. Aims. We constrained the amplitude of intrinsic
alignment and test models by making use of the overlap between
the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS)
covering 3500 deg$^{2}$ and spectroscopic data from the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS/eBOSS). By comparing our
results to measurements from other lensing surveys on the same
spectroscopic tracers, we can test the reliability of these
estimates. Methods. We measured projected correlation functions
between positions and ellipticities, which we modelled with
perturbation theory to constrain the commonly used non-linear
alignment model and its higher order expansion. We computed an
analytical covariance matrix and validated it using jackknife
estimates. Results. Using the non-linear alignment model, we
obtained a 13{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection with CMASS
galaxies, a 3{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection with LRGs, and a
detection compatible with the null hypothesis for ELGs. We
tested the tidal alignment and tidal torque model. This is a
higher order alignment model that we found to be in good
agreement with the non-linear alignment prediction and for which
we were able to constrain the second-order parameters. We
demonstrate the strong scaling of our intrinsic alignment
amplitude with luminosity. We also demonstrate that the UNIONS
sample is robust against systematic contributions, particularly
concerning the point spread function (PSF) biases. We reached a
reasonable agreement when comparing our measurements to other
lensing samples for the same spectroscopic samples. We take this
agreement as an indication that direct measurements of intrinsic
alignment are mature for stage IV priors.}},

0.32$ and $10 \leq \log_{10}(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot) \leq 12$
change as a result of the merger process. To this end, we
construct two samples of galaxies obtained from the Ultraviolet
Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), comprising 1 623
post-mergers and $\sim$30 000 non-merging controls, that live in
low-density environments to use as our lenses. These samples are
weighted to share the same distributions of stellar mass,
redshift, and geometric mean distance to a galaxy's three
nearest neighbours to ensure differences in the lensing signal
are due to the merger process itself. We do not detect a
statistically significant difference in the excess surface
density profile of post-mergers and non-merging controls with
current data. Fitting haloes composed of a point-like stellar
mass component and an extended DM structure described by a
Navarro-Frenk-White profile to the lensing measurements yields,
for both samples, halo masses of $M_\text{halo} \sim
4\times10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a moderately negative
correlation between $M_\text{halo}$ and concentration $c$. This
allows us to rule out, at the 95\% confidence level, merger-
induced starbursts in which more than 60\% of the stellar mass
is formed in the burst. The application of our methods to
upcoming surveys that are able to provide samples

discovered with an isolated galaxy acting as the lens: iPTF16geu
and SN Zwicky. The observed image fluxes for both lens systems
were inconsistent with predictions from a smooth macro lens
model. A potential explanation for the anomalous flux ratios is
microlensing: additional (de)magnification caused by stars and
other compact objects in the lens galaxy. In this work, we
combine observations of iPTF16geu and SN Zwicky with simulated
microlensing magnification maps, leveraging their standardizable
candle properties to constrain the lens galaxy mass slope,
$\eta$, and the fraction of dark compact objects, $f_{\rm dc}$.
The resulting mass slopes are $\eta = 1.70 \pm 0.07$ for
iPTF16geu and $\eta = 1.81 \pm 0.10$ for SN Zwicky. Our results
indicate no evidence for a population of dark compact objects,
placing upper limits at the $95\%$ confidence level of $f_{\rm
dc} < 0.25$ for iPTF16geu and $f_{\rm dc} < 0.47$ for SN Zwicky.
Assuming a constant fraction of dark compact objects for both
lensed SNe, we obtain $f_{\rm dc} < 0.19$. These results
highlight the potential of strongly lensed SNIa to probe the
innermost parts of lens galaxies and learn about compact matter.}},

 abstract = {{Observations of galaxy-scale strong gravitational lensing systems enable
unique tests of departures from general relativity at the kilo-
to megaparsec scale. In this work, the gravitational slip
parameter {\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{PN}$, measuring the amplitude
of a hypothetical fifth force, is constrained using 130
elliptical galaxy lens systems. We implement a lens model with a
power-law total mass density and a deprojected De Vaucouleurs
luminosity density, favored over a power-law luminosity density.
To break the degeneracy between the lens velocity anisotropy
{\ensuremath{\beta}} and the gravitational slip, we introduce a
new prior on the velocity anisotropy based on recent dynamical
data. For a constant gravitational slip, we find
{\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{PN}$=0.9 0$_{-0.14}$$^{+0.18}$ in
agreement with general relativity at the 68\% confidence level.
Introducing a Compton wavelength {\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{g}$,
effectively screening the fifth force at small and large scales,
the best fit is obtained for
{\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{g}${\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 Mpc and
{\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{PN}$=0.7 7$_{-0.14}$$^{+0.25}$. A local
minimum is found at
{\ensuremath{\lambda}}$_{g}${\ensuremath{\sim}}100 Mpc and
{\ensuremath{\gamma}}$_{PN}$=0.5 6$_{-0.35}$$^{0.45}$. We
conclude that there is no evidence in the data for a significant
departure from general relativity and that using accurate
assumptions and having good constraints on the lens galaxy model
is key to ensure reliable constraints on the gravitational slip.}},
