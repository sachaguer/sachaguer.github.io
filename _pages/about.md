**I am a PhD student in observational cosmology using weak gravitational lensing to constrain the growth of structures in the Universe.** I am interested in statistical inference methods to extract more information from the cosmological data such as [Implicit Likelihood Inference](https://sbi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

I am involved in the analysis of data from the Ultraviolet Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey ([UNIONS](https://www.skysurvey.cc/)), a collaboration between the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), Pan-STARS, and the Subaru Telescope to image 5000 degÂ² of the northern sky in four bands ($u$, $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$). I am also a member of the [_Euclid_ Consortium](https://www.euclid-ec.org/), a space mission from the European Space Agency ([ESA](https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Euclid)) that will map the geometry of the dark Universe. In both collaboration, I contribute to the development of validation tests on the weak lensing measurement and participate in.
